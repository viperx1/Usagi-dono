# Episode Sorting Implementation Summary

## Issue Addressed

GitHub Issue: "mylist" - Improve handling of episode number sorting and display

## Problem

The mylist feature was using text-based sorting for episode numbers, which caused:
- Incorrect sort order: "1", "10", "2" instead of "1", "2", "10"
- Leading zeros displayed: "01" instead of "1"
- No grouping by episode type (regular, special, credit, etc.)
- Redundant use of `type` field from API (was being ignored)

## Solution

Implemented proper episode sorting using the `type` field from the AniDB API:

1. **Added type column** to episode database table (1=regular, 2=special, 3=credit, 4=trailer, 5=parody, 6=other)
2. **Parse and store type** from API responses (EPISODE command code 240, FILE command code 220)
3. **Sort episodes** by type first, then numerically within each type
4. **Remove leading zeros** from display (convert to int and back to string)
5. **Format display** based on type (e.g., "Special 1", "Credit 1")

## Code Changes

### Files Modified
- `usagi/src/anidbapi.cpp` - Added type column to database, updated API parsing
- `usagi/src/window.cpp` - Updated mylist loading and display logic
- `tests/test_episode_sorting.cpp` - Added comprehensive test suite (NEW)
- `tests/CMakeLists.txt` - Added new test to build configuration
- `EPISODE_SORTING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Full implementation documentation (NEW)

### Key Changes

**anidbapi.cpp:**
```cpp
// Database schema
query.exec("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `episode`(..., `type` INTEGER);");

// EPISODE response parsing (code 240)
QString type = token2.size() > 10 ? token2.at(10) : "0";

// FILE response parsing (code 220)
// Derive type from epno prefix if not provided
if(epnoUpper.startsWith("S")) eptype = "2";  // Special
```

**window.cpp:**
```cpp
// Query with type field
QString query = "SELECT ... e.type ... ORDER BY a.nameromaji, e.type, CAST(...epno... AS INTEGER)";

// Remove leading zeros
int epNum = numericPart.toInt(&ok);
if(ok) numericPart = QString::number(epNum);

// Format display
if(eptype == 2) episodeNumber = QString("Special %1").arg(numericPart);
```

## Testing

Created `test_episode_sorting.cpp` with tests for:
- Leading zero removal: "01" → "1", "001" → "1"
- Type-based formatting: "S01" → "Special 1", "C01" → "Credit 1"
- Numeric sorting: 1, 2, 10, 100 (not 1, 10, 2, 100)
- Type grouping: Regular episodes first, then specials, etc.

All tests verify the logic matches the implementation in window.cpp.

## Result

**Before:**
```
Episode list (text sort):
- 01
- 010  
- 02
- S01
- 100
```

**After:**
```
Episode list (type + numeric sort):
- 1
- 2
- 10
- 100
- Special 1
```

## API Reference

From AniDB UDP API Definition:

**EPISODE Command Response (240):**
```
eid|aid|length|rating|votes|epno|eng|romaji|kanji|aired|type
```

Where `type` values are:
- 1: regular episode (no prefix)
- 2: special ("S")
- 3: credit ("C")
- 4: trailer ("T")
- 5: parody ("P")
- 6: other ("O")

And `epno` includes the prefix (e.g., "S01", "C01") with zero-padding.

## Migration & Compatibility

- Changes are **backward compatible** with existing databases
- `ALTER TABLE` commands add the type column if missing
- Existing episodes without type will be treated as regular episodes (type 1)
- The `epno` field is still stored for reference

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Correct sorting** - Episodes sort numerically within type groups
2. ✅ **Better organization** - Episodes grouped by type before sorting
3. ✅ **Cleaner display** - No leading zeros cluttering the UI
4. ✅ **Type awareness** - Application can now filter/process episodes by type
5. ✅ **API compliance** - Properly uses the `type` field from AniDB API

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements based on this foundation:
- Filter mylist by episode type (show only regular, only specials, etc.)
- Batch operations on episode types (mark all specials as watched)
- Statistics per episode type (e.g., "50 regular, 3 specials")
- Custom sort orders (allow user to choose sort preference)
