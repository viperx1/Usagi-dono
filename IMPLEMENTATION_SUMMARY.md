# Implementation Summary: MyList Sorting and Aggregate Statistics

## Issue
**Title:** mylist  
**Description:** Set default sorting order of episode column to ascending. In "anime" rows add values to columns: episode (in_mylist/total_primary_type_episodes), viewed (viewed/in_mylist)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Default Sorting Changed
**File:** `usagi/src/window.cpp`  
**Line:** 1256  
**Change:** 
```cpp
// Before:
mylistTreeWidget->sortByColumn(0, Qt::AscendingOrder);

// After:
mylistTreeWidget->sortByColumn(1, Qt::AscendingOrder);
```

**Impact:** The MyList tree now sorts by the Episode column (column 1) in ascending order instead of by the Anime name (column 0). This makes it easier to see which anime have fewer or more episodes in the collection.

### 2. Aggregate Statistics Added to Anime Rows

#### Episode Column (Column 1)
**Format:** `in_mylist/eptotal`  
**Implementation:**
```cpp
// Column 1 (Episode): show in_mylist/eptotal
if(totalEpisodes > 0)
{
    animeItem->setText(1, QString("%1/%2").arg(episodesInMylist).arg(totalEpisodes));
}
else
{
    // If eptotal is not available, just show count in mylist
    animeItem->setText(1, QString::number(episodesInMylist));
}
```

**Examples:**
- "12/24" = 12 episodes in mylist out of 24 total primary episodes
- "37/37" = Complete series (all primary episodes in mylist)
- "5" = 5 episodes in mylist (when eptotal is unavailable)

**Data Source:** 
- `in_mylist` = Counted from mylist entries for each anime
- `eptotal` = From `anime.eptotal` field (total regular/primary type episodes)

#### Viewed Column (Column 4)
**Format:** `viewed/in_mylist`  
**Implementation:**
```cpp
// Column 4 (Viewed): show viewed/in_mylist
animeItem->setText(4, QString("%1/%2").arg(viewedEpisodes).arg(episodesInMylist));
```

**Examples:**
- "8/12" = 8 episodes viewed out of 12 in mylist (66% watched)
- "37/37" = All collected episodes watched (100% complete)
- "0/5" = None of the 5 collected episodes watched yet

**Data Source:**
- `viewed` = Counted from mylist entries where `viewed = 1`
- `in_mylist` = Total count of mylist entries for each anime

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### Statistics Tracking
Three QMap structures added to track per-anime data:
```cpp
QMap<int, int> animeEpisodeCount;  // aid -> count of episodes in mylist
QMap<int, int> animeViewedCount;   // aid -> count of viewed episodes
QMap<int, int> animeEpTotal;       // aid -> total primary type episodes (eptotal)
```

#### Initialization
When creating a new anime item:
```cpp
// Initialize counters for this anime
animeEpisodeCount[aid] = 0;
animeViewedCount[aid] = 0;
animeEpTotal[aid] = epTotal;
```

#### Accumulation
For each episode processed:
```cpp
// Update statistics for this anime
animeEpisodeCount[aid]++;
if(viewed)
{
    animeViewedCount[aid]++;
}
```

#### Display Update
After all episodes are processed:
```cpp
// Update anime rows with aggregate statistics
for(QMap<int, QTreeWidgetItem*>::iterator it = animeItems.begin(); it != animeItems.end(); ++it)
{
    int aid = it.key();
    QTreeWidgetItem *animeItem = it.value();
    
    int episodesInMylist = animeEpisodeCount[aid];
    int viewedEpisodes = animeViewedCount[aid];
    int totalEpisodes = animeEpTotal[aid];
    
    // Update columns...
}
```

## Code Statistics
- **Files modified:** 1 (`usagi/src/window.cpp`)
- **Lines added:** 43
- **Lines deleted:** 2
- **Net change:** +41 lines
- **Function modified:** `Window::loadMylistFromDatabase()`

## Documentation Added
1. **MYLIST_SORTING_AND_STATS.md** - Comprehensive technical documentation
2. **MYLIST_UI_MOCKUP_NEW.txt** - Visual mockup showing new features
3. This summary document

## Testing Notes

### Cannot Runtime Test
Qt6 is not available in the CI environment, so the changes have been reviewed for correctness but not runtime tested.

### Validation Performed
1. ✅ Code review completed with no issues found
2. ✅ Logic verified against requirements
3. ✅ Edge cases handled (missing eptotal)
4. ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
5. ✅ Follows existing code patterns and style

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **Missing eptotal:** Shows just episode count instead of ratio
2. **Multiple episodes per anime:** Properly accumulates statistics
3. **Viewed status:** Correctly counts viewed episodes
4. **Empty mylist:** Handles gracefully (no crashes)

## Benefits

1. **Better Overview:** Users can quickly see collection completeness for each anime
2. **Progress Tracking:** Viewed ratio shows watch progress at a glance
3. **Improved Sorting:** Default episode column sorting helps identify anime with fewer episodes
4. **No Breaking Changes:** Episode items (children) retain their existing display format
5. **Performance:** Statistics calculated once during load, not on-demand

│  ├─                          1          Yes
│  └─                          2          No

│  ├─                          1          Yes
│  └─                          5          Yes
