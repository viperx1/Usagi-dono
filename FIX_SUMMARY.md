# Fix Summary: test_anime_titles Failure

## Problem
The `test_anime_titles` test was failing on Windows CI builds with no detailed error message.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. QNetworkAccessManager Signal Handler Not Validating URL
**Issue**: The `onAnimeTitlesDownloaded()` slot was connected to `QNetworkAccessManager::finished` signal, which fires for ALL network requests made through that manager. The handler didn't validate which request the reply was for.

**Impact**: 
- Any network reply would be processed as if it were anime titles data
- Could attempt to decompress non-gzip data
- Could insert invalid data into database
- Could cause crashes or test failures

**Fix**: Added URL validation at the start of `onAnimeTitlesDownloaded()` to check if the reply is actually for the anime titles download URL before processing.

```cpp
// Check if this reply is for the anime titles download
QUrl requestUrl = reply->request().url();
if(requestUrl.toString() != "http://anidb.net/api/anime-titles.dat.gz")
{
    // This reply is for a different request, ignore it
    reply->deleteLater();
    return;
}
```

### 2. Database Connection Conflict Between Tests
**Issue**: Multiple test suites (`test_anidbapi` and `test_anime_titles`) each create an `AniDBApi` instance. Each constructor tried to create a new default database connection using `QSqlDatabase::addDatabase("QSQLITE")` without checking if one already exists.

**Impact**: 
- Second test suite would fail when trying to add duplicate default connection
- Qt would issue error/warning about connection already existing
- Tests would fail to initialize properly

**Fix**: Added check to reuse existing database connection if it already exists:

```cpp
// Check if default database connection already exists (e.g., in tests)
if(QSqlDatabase::contains(QSqlDatabase::defaultConnection))
{
    db = QSqlDatabase::database();
}
else
{
    db = QSqlDatabase::addDatabase("QSQLITE");
}
```

## Changes Made
- Modified `usagi/src/anidbapi.cpp`:
  - Added URL validation in `onAnimeTitlesDownloaded()` (9 lines added)
  - Added database connection reuse logic in constructor (8 lines added)
  
**Total**: 17 lines added, minimal and surgical changes

## Testing Impact
These fixes ensure that:
1. Network handlers only process their intended responses
2. Multiple test instances can safely share database connections
3. Tests run independently without interference from background network operations
4. No crashes occur from processing invalid data

## Verification
The fixes address the specific failure modes that would cause `test_anime_titles` to fail:
- ✅ Prevents processing of unrelated network replies
- ✅ Allows multiple AniDBApi instances in test environment
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with production code
- ✅ No changes to test code required
