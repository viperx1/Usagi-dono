# MyList Field Update Implementation

## Overview
Implemented targeted field updates for episode data in the MyList view instead of refreshing the entire list when a single episode's data is received from the API.

## Problem
Previously, when episode data was received from the API (via `getNotifyEpisodeUpdated`), the entire mylist tree was cleared and reloaded by calling `loadMylistFromDatabase()`. This was inefficient because:
- The entire tree widget was cleared (`mylistTreeWidget->clear()`)
- The entire database was re-queried for all mylist entries
- All anime and episode items were rebuilt from scratch
- The expansion state of the tree was lost
- Visual flicker occurred during the refresh

## Solution
The new implementation updates only the specific episode item in the tree:
1. Queries the database for only the updated episode's data (epno and name)
2. Finds the specific episode item in the tree by iterating through the matching anime's children
3. Updates only the episode number and name fields (columns 1 and 2)
4. Keeps all other tree items, state, and expansion intact
5. Removes the episode from the `episodesNeedingData` tracking set

## Changes Made

### API Layer (No Changes)
The API layer remains unchanged - it still emits `notifyEpisodeUpdated(eid, aid)` when episode data is received.

### UI Layer (`usagi/src/window.h` and `usagi/src/window.cpp`)

#### Added Method Declaration
```cpp
void updateEpisodeInTree(int eid, int aid);
```
- New method to update a specific episode item in the tree
- Does not refresh the entire list

#### Modified `getNotifyEpisodeUpdated`
```cpp
// Before:
void Window::getNotifyEpisodeUpdated(int eid, int aid)
{
    logOutput->append(QString("Episode data received for EID %1 (AID %2), refreshing display...").arg(eid).arg(aid));
    loadMylistFromDatabase();  // Refreshed entire list
}

// After:
void Window::getNotifyEpisodeUpdated(int eid, int aid)
{
    logOutput->append(QString("Episode data received for EID %1 (AID %2), updating field...").arg(eid).arg(aid));
    updateEpisodeInTree(eid, aid);  // Updates only the specific episode
}
```

#### Added `updateEpisodeInTree` Implementation
The new method:
1. **Queries Database**: Fetches only `epno` and `name` for the specific EID
2. **Finds Episode Item**: Iterates through top-level anime items to find the matching AID, then searches its children for the matching EID
3. **Updates Fields**: Sets the episode number (column 1) and name (column 2) using the same parsing logic as `loadMylistFromDatabase`
4. **Maintains Consistency**: Uses identical episode number parsing (Special, Credit, Trailer, Parody, Other, or regular number)
5. **Cleanup**: Removes the episode from `episodesNeedingData` tracking set
6. **Logging**: Provides informative log messages about the update

## Algorithm Details

### Episode Number Parsing
The implementation uses the same logic as the original `loadMylistFromDatabase`:
- `S` prefix → "Special {number}"
- `C` prefix → "Credit {number}"
- `T` prefix → "Trailer {number}"
- `P` prefix → "Parody {number}"
- `O` prefix → "Other {number}"
- Regular number → displayed as-is

### Tree Iteration
- Iterates only through top-level items (anime)
- For matching anime (by AID), iterates through child items (episodes)
- For matching episode (by EID), updates the text fields directly
- Early return when found to avoid unnecessary iteration

## Benefits

### Performance
- **Minimal Database Query**: Single `SELECT epno, name FROM episode WHERE eid = ?` instead of full join query
- **No Tree Rebuild**: Existing tree structure is preserved
- **Reduced CPU**: No clearing/rebuilding of potentially hundreds of tree items
- **Better Memory**: No allocation/deallocation of all tree items

### User Experience
- **No Visual Flicker**: Tree remains stable during update
- **Expansion State Preserved**: User's expanded/collapsed state is maintained
- **Scroll Position Preserved**: User's scroll position is maintained
- **Immediate Update**: Only the relevant field changes, making the update more noticeable

### Code Quality
- **Surgical Change**: Only the necessary data is updated
- **Consistent Logic**: Uses same episode number parsing as original
- **Better Logging**: More specific log messages about what was updated
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling if episode item is not found

## Usage Flow

1. **User Expands Anime**: Triggers `onMylistItemExpanded()`
2. **API Request Queued**: EPISODE command is queued for missing data
3. **API Response**: AniDB sends 240 EPISODE response
4. **Database Update**: Episode data is stored in the database
5. **Signal Emitted**: `notifyEpisodeUpdated(eid, aid)` is emitted
6. **Tree Update**: `updateEpisodeInTree()` finds and updates only the specific episode item
7. **User Sees**: Episode fields change from "Loading..." to actual values without any flicker

## Testing

### Manual Testing Required
Without Qt environment, the following manual tests should be performed:
1. Load mylist with missing episode data (should show "Loading...")
2. Expand an anime item
3. Wait for API response
4. Verify only the episode fields update (no tree rebuild)
5. Verify expansion state is preserved
6. Verify scroll position is preserved
7. Verify log shows "updating field..." instead of "refreshing display..."

### Expected Log Output
```
Episode data received for EID 123 (AID 456), updating field...
Updated episode in tree: EID 123, epno: 1, name: Episode Title
```

## Comparison

### Before (Full Refresh)
```
getNotifyEpisodeUpdated(eid, aid)
  ↓
loadMylistFromDatabase()
  ↓
mylistTreeWidget->clear()  // Clear ALL items
  ↓
Query entire database (all mylist entries)
  ↓
Rebuild ALL anime and episode items
  ↓
User sees flicker and loses expansion state
```

### After (Targeted Update)
```
getNotifyEpisodeUpdated(eid, aid)
  ↓
updateEpisodeInTree(eid, aid)
  ↓
Query database for ONE episode
  ↓
Find specific episode item in tree
  ↓
Update TWO text fields
  ↓
User sees smooth update, keeps expansion state
```

## Code Statistics
- Files changed: 2 (`window.h`, `window.cpp`)
- Lines added: ~108
- Lines removed: ~2
- Net change: +106 lines
- New methods: 1 (`updateEpisodeInTree`)
- Modified methods: 1 (`getNotifyEpisodeUpdated`)

## Future Enhancements
Possible improvements:
- Cache episode item pointers by EID for faster lookups
- Batch multiple episode updates if several arrive quickly
- Add visual indicator (e.g., highlight) for recently updated episodes
- Implement undo/redo for manual episode data edits
