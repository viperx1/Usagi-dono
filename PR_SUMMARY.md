# Pull Request Summary: Episode Format Change

## Overview
This PR implements a new format for displaying episode counts in the mylist anime rows, changing from "A/B" to "A/B+C" format to better distinguish between normal episodes and other types (specials, OVAs, etc.).

## Issue Reference
Issue: "mylist" - Change the format in "episode" column in "anime" row

## Changes Made

### Code Changes
**File: `usagi/src/window.cpp`**
- Modified `Window::loadMylistFromDatabase()` function
- Added tracking for normal episodes (type 1) vs other types (types 2-6) separately
- Updated display logic to show new format

### New Format

**Episode Column: "A/B+C"**
- A = normal episodes (type 1) in mylist
- B = total normal episodes (from anime.eptotal)
- C = sum of other episode types (2-6: special, credit, trailer, parody, other)

**Viewed Column: "A/B+C"**
- A = normal episodes (type 1) viewed
- B = normal episodes (type 1) in mylist
- C = other episode types (2-6) viewed

### Examples

| Scenario | Episode Column | Viewed Column | Meaning |
|----------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| All normal episodes | `12/12` | `10/12` | 12 of 12 normal eps, 10 viewed |
| With specials | `12/12+2` | `10/12+1` | All 12 normal + 2 specials, 10 normal + 1 special viewed |
| Incomplete series | `10/26+3` | `8/10+2` | 10 of 26 normal + 3 other, 8 normal + 2 other viewed |
| No eptotal | `15+2` | `12/15+1` | 15 normal + 2 other (total unknown), 12 normal + 1 other viewed |

### Documentation Added

1. **EPISODE_FORMAT_CHANGE.md**
   - Technical documentation
   - Implementation details
   - Test scenarios with expected outputs
   - Edge cases and future enhancements

2. **EPISODE_FORMAT_EXAMPLES.md**
   - Visual before/after comparison
   - Multiple real-world examples
   - Episode type breakdown
   - UI column layout explanation

## Technical Details

### Episode Types
```cpp
1 = regular episode (no prefix)
2 = special ("S" prefix)
3 = credit ("C" prefix)
4 = trailer ("T" prefix)
5 = parody ("P" prefix)
6 = other ("O" prefix)
```

### Implementation Highlights

1. **Type Detection**: Uses existing `epno` class to determine episode type
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Handles missing data elegantly (e.g., "10/12" instead of "10/12+0")
3. **Minimal Changes**: Only modifies display logic, no database schema changes
4. **Backward Compatible**: Uses existing data structures and doesn't break existing functionality

### Code Structure
```cpp
// Track statistics by episode type
QMap<int, int> animeNormalEpisodeCount;    // Type 1 episodes
QMap<int, int> animeOtherEpisodeCount;     // Types 2-6 episodes
QMap<int, int> animeNormalViewedCount;     // Type 1 viewed
QMap<int, int> animeOtherViewedCount;      // Types 2-6 viewed

// During episode processing
int episodeType = episodeNumber.type();
if(episodeType == 1)
    animeNormalEpisodeCount[aid]++;
else
    animeOtherEpisodeCount[aid]++;

// Generate display string
if(otherEpisodes > 0)
    text = QString("%1/%2+%3").arg(normalEps, totalEps, otherEps);
else
    text = QString("%1/%2").arg(normalEps, totalEps);
```

## Testing

### Manual Verification
- Walked through logic with multiple test scenarios
- Verified correct counting and display for:
  - Anime with only normal episodes
  - Anime with mixed episode types
  - Anime without eptotal data
  - Complete/incomplete series
  - All/partial viewing states

### Test Scenarios Documented
See EPISODE_FORMAT_CHANGE.md sections:
- Scenario 1: Only normal episodes
- Scenario 2: Normal + special episodes
- Scenario 3: Mixed episode types
- Scenario 4: Without eptotal data
- Scenario 5: All episodes viewed

## Benefits

1. **Clearer Information**: Users can see at a glance how many specials/OVAs they have
2. **Better Progress Tracking**: Separate normal episode progress from bonus content
3. **Consistent Format**: Both Episode and Viewed columns use the same structure
4. **No Data Loss**: Original display for anime without other types remains unchanged

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **No other episodes**: Shows "A/B" (omits "+0")
2. **No eptotal**: Shows "A+C" (omits "/B")
3. **No data**: Defaults to type 1 (normal episode)
4. **Lazy loading**: Works with existing episode data loading mechanism

## Files Changed

- `usagi/src/window.cpp` - Core implementation (89 lines changed)
- `EPISODE_FORMAT_CHANGE.md` - Technical documentation (new file, 168 lines)
- `EPISODE_FORMAT_EXAMPLES.md` - Visual examples (new file, 171 lines)

## Total Changes
- 3 files changed
- 415 insertions(+)
- 13 deletions(-)

## Commits
1. Initial plan
2. Implement episode format A/B+C for anime rows
3. Add documentation for episode format change
4. Clarify viewed column format documentation
5. Add visual examples of episode format changes

## Notes

- This change only affects the display in anime parent rows
- Individual episode child rows remain unchanged
- No database schema changes required
- Uses existing `epno` class for episode type detection
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing data

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. Add tooltips showing breakdown of episode types
2. Update anime row statistics when episode data is lazy-loaded
3. Consider sorting implications of new format
4. Ensure export features handle the display format correctly

## Testing Recommendations

To verify this implementation after building:

1. Build the application with CMake
2. Log in to AniDB and load mylist
3. Verify anime rows show new format
4. Test with anime having:
   - Only normal episodes
   - Mixed episode types
   - No eptotal data
   - Various viewing states
5. Expand anime rows to see child episodes remain unchanged
6. Sort by episode column to ensure sorting still works correctly
