# MyList View Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the MyList view interface to enhance usability and information display.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Episode Title Column
- **Previous**: Episode column combined episode number and title (e.g., "Episode 1 - Complete Movie")
- **Current**: Separate columns for episode number and episode title
  - Column "Episode": Shows episode number or type
  - Column "Episode Title": Shows episode name

### 2. Enhanced Episode Type Display
The Episode column now intelligently displays the episode type based on the episode number format from AniDB:

- **Regular Episodes**: Shows the episode number as-is (e.g., "1", "2", "12")
- **Special Episodes**: "S1" → "Special 1", "S2" → "Special 2"
- **Credits/OP/ED**: "C1" → "Credit 1", "C2" → "Credit 2"
- **Trailers**: "T1" → "Trailer 1", "T2" → "Trailer 2"
- **Parodies**: "P1" → "Parody 1", "P2" → "Parody 2"
- **Other**: "O1" → "Other 1", "O2" → "Other 2"
- **Fallback**: If episode number is not available, displays the Episode ID (EID)

### 3. Collapsed Anime Entries by Default
- **Previous**: All anime entries were expanded by default, showing all episodes
- **Current**: Anime entries are collapsed by default
  - Users can manually expand/collapse anime entries as needed
  - Reduces visual clutter when viewing large lists
  - Improves initial load performance

## Column Layout

The MyList tree widget now has 7 columns:

| # | Column Name    | Width | Description                                    |
|---|----------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| 0 | Anime          | 300px | Anime title (parent items only)                |
| 1 | Episode        | 80px  | Episode number or type                         |
| 2 | Episode Title  | 250px | Episode name/title                             |
| 3 | State          | 100px | File state (HDD, CD/DVD, Deleted, Unknown)     |
| 4 | Viewed         | 80px  | Whether episode has been viewed (Yes/No)       |
| 5 | Storage        | 200px | Storage location/identifier                    |
| 6 | Mylist ID      | 80px  | MyList entry ID (LID)                          |

## Technical Details

### Modified Files
- `usagi/src/window.cpp`: Updated MyList tree widget initialization and display logic

### Key Changes in Code
1. Changed `setColumnCount(6)` to `setColumnCount(7)`
2. Updated `setHeaderLabels()` to include "Episode Title" column
3. Adjusted column widths to accommodate the new column
4. Separated episode number parsing logic from episode title display
5. Removed `mylistTreeWidget->expandAll()` call
6. Updated all `setText()` calls to use correct column indices

## User Impact

### Benefits
- **Clearer Information**: Episode type is immediately visible without reading the full title
- **Better Organization**: Separate columns make it easier to sort and filter
- **Reduced Clutter**: Collapsed entries by default show only anime titles initially
- **Improved Scanning**: Users can quickly identify special episodes, OPs, EDs, etc.

### Usage
- Click the expand/collapse arrow next to an anime title to show/hide its episodes
- Double-click an anime title to expand/collapse
- Use column headers to sort by any field
- Resize columns by dragging the column dividers

## Example Display

```
Anime                          | Episode    | Episode Title        | State | Viewed | Storage    | Mylist ID
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
▶ Cowboy Bebop                 |            |                      |       |        |            |
▶ Ghost in the Shell: SAC      |            |                      |       |        |            |
▼ Neon Genesis Evangelion      |            |                      |       |        |            |
  │                            | 1          | Angel Attack         | HDD   | Yes    | /anime/... | 12345
  │                            | 2          | The Beast            | HDD   | Yes    | /anime/... | 12346
  │                            | Special 1  | Director's Cut       | HDD   | No     | /anime/... | 12347
  │                            | Credit 1   | Opening              | HDD   | Yes    | /anime/... | 12348
```

## Compatibility Notes
- The changes are backward compatible with existing database schemas
- No database migrations required
- Episode data is fetched from the existing `episode` table with `epno` field
- Works with both manual mylist entries and CSV import

## Related Issues
- Issue: "let's improve mylist view. i don't need episode column to show eid. it should show episode number or episode type (in case it's some special type: intro/outro/special/etc). add episode title column. also keep anime entries collapsed by default."

## Future Enhancements
Potential future improvements could include:
- Custom column visibility/ordering preferences
- Save expand/collapse state per anime
- Filter by episode type (show only specials, etc.)
- Batch operations on collapsed anime entries
